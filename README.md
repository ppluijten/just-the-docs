# just-the-docs

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a [Jekyll] site that:

- uses the [Just the Docs] theme;
- is published on [GitHub Pages];
- can be built and previewed locally.

## Building and previewing your site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

## Customization

You're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like!

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.
